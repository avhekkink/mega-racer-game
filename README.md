# Mega-Racer
The aim of this project was to implement the graphics of a simple racing game (which was already provided with game logic). In doing so, I aimed to make the game look more interesting and photorealistic. The techniques I used to achieve this included implementing cameras, texturing, Lambertian lighting and shading.
